What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository a hidden folder called .git is created in the directory.
	This folder stores metadata git needs about the history of your files.
	You need to initialize the repostory to create a git repository, rather than just
	a directory, or folder.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area allows you to selectively add files to make a logical commit.
	The working directory contains all the files in the folder.  The repository 
	contains the files you've commited and history about them in metadate .git folder.
