When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	You'd want a remote repository if you wanted to collaborate with other people, or
	if you wanted to work on a project from multiple computers and you wanted to be 
	able to easily move changes made on one machine to the other.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote rephository?
	Manual pulls mean that you control when you want to merge changes from the remote 
	repository into any local changes you have made.  If git automatically stayed up-to-date
	then if there were many other people contributing to the repository you were working on
	you'd be constantly having to merge their changes into yours.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
		Forks are used to create your own copy on github of someone else's existing repository
		on github.  This allows you to make your own changes to your copy of the repository.
		Clones allow you to copy a repository.  Repositories can be cloned from github or from 
		a local repository.
		Branches allow you to name a series of commits on a specific repository.  You can have
		many branches on a repository.  The different branches might be used for different
		development efforts or experiments while maintaining a working copy of the production code,
		if the repository is for code. 
		 
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	You can work offline, but still have the latest copy of the remote branch available locally.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Well, you could use a different form of version control.  But, githubs pull requests
	are very handy for collaboration and for reviewing changes, so having to do without
	that would make things harder.
