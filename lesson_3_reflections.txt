When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	You'd want a remote repository if you wanted to collaborate with other people, or
	if you wanted to work on a project from multiple computers and you wanted to be 
	able to easily move changes made on one machine to the other.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote rephository?
	Manual pulls mean that you control when you want to merge changes from the remote 
	repository into any local changes you have made.  If git automatically stayed up-to-date
	then if there were many other people contributing to the repository you were working on
	you'd be constantly having to merge their changes into yours.
